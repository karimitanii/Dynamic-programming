#  Minimum Cost to Destination - Train & Bus (Dynamic Programming)

##  Problem Statement  
You are given a transportation system consisting of **trains and buses**. Each mode of transport has an associated travel cost at every station, and there is an additional **cost for switching** between train and bus at any station. The goal is to determine the **minimum cost to reach the final destination** while optimizing the switching between train and bus.

##  Approach  
This problem is solved using **Dynamic Programming (DP)** with **O(n) time complexity**.


## üõ†Ô∏è Languages Used  
- **Java**
- **Python**
